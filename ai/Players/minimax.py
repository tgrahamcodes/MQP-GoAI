    Problem 1: TicTacToe and MiniMax AI player 
    In this problem, you will implement two different AI players for the TicTacToe game.
'''

#-------------------------------------------------------
''' 
    AI Player 1 (Random Player): Let's first implement the simplest player agent (Random Agent) to get familiar with TicTacToe AI.
'''
#-------------------------------------------------------
class RandomPlayer(Player):
    '''
        Random player: it chooses a random valid move at each step of the game. 
        This player is the simplest AI agent for the tic-tac-toe game. 
        It is also the foundation of Monte-Carlo Sampling which we will need to use later.
    '''
    # ----------------------------------------------
    def choose_a_move(self,g,s):
        '''
            The action function, which chooses one random valid move in each step of the game.  
            This function will be called by the game at each game step.
            For example, suppose we have 2 random players (say A and B) in a game.
            The game will call the choose_a_move() function of the two players in turns as follows:

            Repeat until game ends:
                (1) r,c = A.choose_a_move(game,game_state, x=1 ) --- "X" player (A) choose a move
                (2) the game updates its game state 
                (3) r,c = B.choose_a_move(game,game_state, x=-1 ) --- "O" player (B) choose a move
                (4) the game updates its game state 

            Input:
                g: the game environment being played, such as TicTacToe or Othello. 
                s: the current state of the game, which is an object of GameState class.
                 (1)s.b represents the current setting of the board, an integer matrix of shape 3 by 3 (TicTacToe) or 8 by 8 (Othello).
                    s.b[i,j] = 0 denotes that the i-th row and j-th column is empty
                    s.b[i,j] = 1 denotes that the i-th row and j-th column is taken by "X" player. 
                    s.b[i,j] = -1 denotes that the i-th row and j-th column is taken by "O" player.
                    For example, in TicTacToe, the following game state 
                     | X |   | O |
                     | O | X |   |
                     | X |   | O |
                    is represented as the following numpy matrix
                    s.b= [[ 1 , 0 ,-1 ],
                          [-1 , 1 , 0 ],
                          [ 1 , 0 ,-1 ]]

                 (2) s.x: who's turn in this step of the game, x=1 if "X" player's turn; x=-1 if "O" player's turn 
           Outputs:
                r: the row number of the next move, an integer scalar.
                c: the column number of the next move, an integer scalar.
            For example, in the above example, the valid moves are the empty grid cells: 
            (r=0,c=1) --- the first row, second column 
            (r=1,c=2) --- the second row, the third column 
            (r=2,c=1) --- the third row , the second column
            The random player should randomly choose one of the valid moves. 
            Hint: for different board games, you can always use get_valid_moves() function in the game.py to get the list of valid moves.
            Hint: you could solve this problem using 3 lines of code.

    AI Player 2 (MiniMax Player): Now let's implement the MiniMax agent for the game.
    The goal of this agent is to find the optimal (best) move for the current game state.
    MiniMax player will build a fully expanded search tree, where each tree node corresponds to a game state.
    The root of the tree is the current game state.
    Then we compute the score (value) of each node recursively using minimax algorithm.
    Finally, the MiniMax agent will choose the child node with the largest value as the next move. 

    For example, suppose the current game state is:
          s.b=[[ 0, 1, 1],
               [ 0,-1,-1],
               [ 1,-1, 1]]
    and it's "O" player's turn (s.x=-1).
    Then the search tree will be: 
   |-------------------
   |Root Node:   
   |  s.b=[[ 0, 1, 1],
   |       [ 0,-1,-1],
   |       [ 1,-1, 1]]     -- the game state in the node
   |  s.x=-1               -- it's "O" player's turn at this step of the game
   |    p= None            -- The root node has no parent node
   |    m= None            -- the move it takes from parent node to this node (no parent node) 
   |    c=[Child_Node_A, Child_Node_B] -- list of children nodes
   |    v=-1               -- The value of the game state:  
   |                            assuming both players follows their optimal moves,
   |                            from this game state,  "O" player will win (-1).
   |----------------------------
      |Child Node A:  ---- If O player chooses the move (r=0,c=0)
      |  s.b=[[-1, 1, 1],
      |       [ 0,-1,-1],
      |       [ 1,-1, 1]] -- the game state in the node
      |  s.x= 1           -- it's "X" player's turn 
      |    p= Root_Node   -- The parent node is the root node
      |    m= (0,0)       -- from parent node, took the move (r=0, c=0) to reach this node
      |    c=[Grand Child Node C] -- list of children nodes
      |    v= 1           -- The value of the game state:  
      |                            assuming both players follows their optimal moves,
      |                            from this game state,  "X" player will win (1).
      |----------------------------
          |Grand Child Node A1: ---- If X player chooses the move (r=1, c=0)
          |  s.b=[[-1, 1, 1],
          |       [ 1,-1,-1],
          |       [ 1,-1, 1]]    -- the game state in the node
          |  s.x=-1              -- it's "O" player's turn 
          |    p= Child_Node_B   -- The parent node is the child node B
          |    m= (1,0)          -- from parent node, took the move (r=1,c=0) to reach this node
          |    c=[] -- list of children nodes, no child node because the game has ended
          |    v= 0               -- The score of the game state:  
          |                          Terminal node, the game ends with a Tie (0).
      |------------------------------ 
      |Child Node B:  ---- If O player chooses the move (r=1,c=0)
      |  s.b=[[ 0, 1, 1],
      |       [-1,-1,-1],
      |       [ 1,-1, 1]]     -- the game state in the node
      |  s.x= 1               -- it's "X" player's turn in this step of the game
      |    p= Root_Node       -- The parent node is the root node
      |    m= (1,0)           -- from parent node, took the move (r=1,c=0) to reach this node
      |    c=[] -- list of children nodes, no child node because the game has ended
      |    v=-1               -- The value of the game state:  
      |                           Terminal node, the game ends: O player won (-1) 
      |--------------------------


        The tree looks like this:
 
                          |--> Child Node A (v=0) |--> Grand Child Node A1 (v=0)
        Root Node(v=-1)-->| 
                          |--> Child Node B (v=-1) 

        In this example, the two children nodes have values as v=0 (child A) and v=-1 (child B). 
        The "O" player will choose the child node with the smallest value as the next move.
        In this example, the smallest value is Child Node B (v=-1), so the optimal next move is (r=1, c=0)


------------------------------------------------------------
MiniMax is a search-tree-based  methods. 
Now let's implement tree nodes first.  Then we can connect the nodes into a search tree.
------------------------------------------------------------
'''
class Node:

    def expand(self,g):
        '''
            In order to build a search tree, we first need to implement an elementary operation:  
            Expand the current tree node by adding one layer of children nodes.
            Add one child node for each valid next move.
        Input:
            self: the node to be expanded
            g: the game environment being played, such as TicTacToe or Othello. 

        For example, in TicTacToe, if the current node (BEFORE expanding) is like:
       |-------------------
       |Current Node:   
       |  s.b=[[ 0, 1,-1],
       |       [ 0,-1, 1],

        There are 3 valid next moves from the current game state.
        AFTER expanding this node, we add three children nodes to the current node.
        The tree looks like this after being expanded:

            Hint: in Othello game, given a parent node p and its child node c,  p.x and c.x NOT necessarily have opposite sign.  When there is no valid move for one player, that player will give up the move, so in this case the p.x and c.x can be the same.

        |-------------------

        AFTER expanding this node, we have a tree as follows:
        The tree looks like this after being expanded:

                                                 |--> Grand Child Node A1 |--> Great Grand Child A11

            Given a fully-built tree, compute optimal values of the all the nodes in the tree using minimax algorithm
            Here we assume that the whole search-tree is fully grown, but no value on any node has been computed yet before calling this function.
           
        Input:
            self: the current node to compute value 
            g: the game environment being played, such as TicTacToe or Othello. 

        MinMax Algorithm: 
        The optimal value of a tree node is defined as follows:
        (1) if the node is a terminal node, the value of the node is the game result (1, -1 or 0)
        (2) if the node has children nodes, which means that it is not a terminal node, and the game has not ended yet 
                (2.1) if it is X player's turn in the current node:
                        the value of the node is maximum value of all the children nodes' values.
                (2.2) if it is O player's turn in the current node:
                        the value of the node is minimum value of all the children nodes' values.

        For example, the current game state is
        |-------------------
        |Current Node:   
        |  s.b=[[ 1,-1, 1],
        |       [ 0, 0, 0],

        The search tree will have 5 levels of children nodes.

        If we finish computing the values of all the Grand Children nodes, we have:

        In Child Node A, it is "O" player's turn, so the value of Child Node A is the MINIMUM of all its children nodes' values: min(1,1,0,1) = 0

        Now the values of all the children nodes of the current node are ready, we can compute the value of the current node.
        In the current node, it is "X" player's turn, so the value of the current node is the MAXIMUM of all its children nodes' values: max(0,0,-1,1,0) = 1
